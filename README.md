## Overview
### Description
Mentor2Mentee simply bridges the gap between students and mentors, one connection at a time. 
At the press of a button, a student can find a mentor in their respective field, schedule a call with them, and the app will help facilitate by allowing students to list goals that they and their mentor come up with, 
along with allowing mentors to leave feedback for students. 


### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Productivity**
- **Mobile: This is a primarily mobile application, with potential to even become a viable web application.**
- **Story:Users who are in need of mentors can create an account, look at a list of mentors in different fields and pick a compatible mentor. Users can also schedule calls with their mentor and track their progress with their mentors.**
- **Market: Students in need of mentors**
- **Habit:This app could be used daily by individuals who need mentors and could use constant assistance**
- **Scope: First, the app would allow users to create accounts and store a list of potential mentors. Next, we would build the aspects that allow for communication and progress tracking between mentors and mentees.**
